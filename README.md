Solution to the binary tree to linked list problem.

I am interested in this problem because it involves a lot of interesting and relevant computer science concepts such as recursion, treses, and linked lists.

In order to write the alorithm to solve the problem I had to create basic versions of classes for Node, Binary tree, and Linked list

The purpose of this project was not at all to build perfect version of these classes, but instead to
create enough of the functionality so that I could adress the problem.
